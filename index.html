    In Season 2, Steve’s relationship with Nancy is strained, and he breaks up with her after she will not say she loves him. His popularity fades. Steve also finds himself at odds with Billy Hargrove, a new student at the school who seeks to belittle him as “king.” Steve becomes involved with Mike Wheeler and his friends after Dustin reveals he found a small creature from the Upside Down. Steve grows close with Dustin and teaches him about self-confidence. Steve protects the children as Demodogs tear through Hawkins, putting himself in harm’s way. He becomes a fan favorite for his older-brother-style relationship with Dustin, and his iconic encounters before Mike in a battle to disable the monster.
